# Image Description Web Application

This project is a web application that allows users to upload an image and receive a text description of its content using a pre-trained machine learning model.

---

## Features

- Upload an image and get a description of its content.
- Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model (e.g., MobileNetV2) for image classification.
- Built with a Flask backend and a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.
- Runs locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- pip (Python package installer)
- TensorFlow and Flask (installed via `requirements.txt`)

---

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-Description-Web-App.git
   cd Image-Description-Web-App
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask Application**

   Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Web App**

   Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Upload an image by clicking the "Choose File" button on the webpage.
2. Click the "Upload & Get Description" button.
3. Wait for the application to process the image.
4. The predicted description will appear on the screen.

---

## Example Output

Here’s how the output might look after uploading an image:

- **Input Image:** [Uploaded Image]
- **Output Description:** "This image likely contains a 'safety pin'."

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Issue: Flask server not starting**  
   - Ensure you’re using the correct Python version.
   - Check that all dependencies are installed.

2. **Issue: Model not found or incorrect path**  
   - Verify the model file (`mobilenetv2.h5`) exists in the `model/` folder.
   - Check the file path in `app.py`.

3. **Issue: Image upload error**  
   - Ensure the image file is valid and meets the accepted format.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- Add support for more image classes and a larger dataset.
- Improve the user interface with advanced styling and interactivity.
