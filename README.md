## Overview

The Image Description Generation project utilizes deep learning models such as CNN and RNNs to automatically generate textual descriptions for images. This project is particularly useful for visually impaired users and can also be applied in automatic tagging and categorization systems.

---

## Features

- *Machine Learning*: Uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for image analysis and description generation.
- *API Development*: A RESTful API built with Flask to handle image input and return the generated description.
- *Customizable*: You can fine-tune the model or use your own dataset for more accurate descriptions.
- *Deployable*: Can be deployed locally or to cloud platforms for scalability.

---

## Technologies Used

- *Python*: Core programming language for image processing and model building.
- *Flask*: Backend server for creating the REST API.
- *TensorFlow/Keras*: Frameworks for building and training deep learning models.
- *Pillow*: Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image processing.
- *NumPy & Pandas*: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- *Matplotlib*: For visualizations during the model development process.

## How to Set Up the Project

### Prerequisites

1. Install *Python (>=3.8)*.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-description-generation.git
   cd image-description-generation
   ```

2. Place your trained model files (e.g., `model.h5`, `tokenizer.pkl`) in the root directory.

3. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:
   - **API**: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/describe`
   - **Web Interface**: `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`

## How to Use the Project

### API Usage

1. Use tools like **Postman** or Pythonâ€™s **requests** library to make POST requests to:

   **Endpoint**: `/describe`

   **Example Input**:
   ```json
   {
       "image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
   }
   ```

   **Example Output**:
   ```json
   {
       "description": "A person playing guitar on stage under bright lights."
   }
   ```

### Web Interface Usage

1. Access the interface at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`.
2. Upload an image using the provided upload button.
3. Click the "Generate Description" button to receive the description for the image.

---

## API Endpoints

### `/describe` (POST)

**Description**: Accepts an image URL or file, processes it, and returns a textual description.

**Input**:
```json
{
    "image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
}
```

**Output**:
```json
{
    "description": "A person playing guitar on stage under bright lights."
}
```

---

## Results

- **Accuracy**: The model generates accurate descriptions with a high degree of reliability. The accuracy can vary depending on the quality and complexity of the input images.
- **Impact**: This system enables accessibility for visually impaired individuals and can be applied in automated content generation, tagging, and categorization.
